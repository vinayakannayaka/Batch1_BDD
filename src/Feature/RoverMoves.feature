Feature: RoverMoves

    Rover should be successfully able to move

    Scenario: Rover Movement
        Given Rover is in plateau at (<X>,<Y>) co-ordinates and faces <Direction>
        When the rover moves
        Then the rover reaches new position (<M>,<N>) in the same <Direction>.
        Examples:
            | X | Y | Direction | M | N |
            | 1 | 1 | N         | 1 | 2 |
            | 1 | 1 | S         | 1 | 0 |
            | 1 | 1 | E         | 2 | 1 |
            | 1 | 1 | W         | 0 | 1 |


    Scenario: Rover movement out of boundary
        Given Rover is in plateau at (<X>,<Y>) co-ordinates and facing<Direction>
        When the rover moves
        Then the rover falls out of the plateau
        Examples:
            | 0 | 0 | W |
            | 0 | 0 | S |
            | 5 | 5 | E |
            | 5 | 5 | N |
            | 0 | 5 | N |
            | 0 | 5 | W |
            | 5 | 0 | E |
            | 5 | 0 | S |
